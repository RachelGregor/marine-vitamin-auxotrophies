This script will check what functions are actually being used in a file so you can remove unused packages. First, run the R file you want to analyze and load all the libraries listed. Then run this script. 

```{r}

#install.packages("NCmisc")

library("NCmisc")

##convert Rmd to R file
knitr::purl("Fig1-isolates/Fig1c-screen.Rmd")


##list functions
list.functions.in.file("Fig1c-screen.R")

```
